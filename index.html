            <h2>Over 100 student-athletes who compete in NCAA-sanctioned sports say they've faced emotional abuse from their coaches. Many more do not speak out - unsure of what they're experiencing or from fear of retaliation. These are the stories of some who did.</h2>

            <p><span style="font-size:3rem;">A</span>cross the country, in various college sports teams, a quiet epidemic has unfolded.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Student-athletes are saying they&rsquo;re being emotionally abused by their coaches.</p>
            <p>Many student-athletes reported mental health impacts as a result of their coaches’ behaviors: panic attacks, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Researchers say athletes experience emotional abuse more than physical or sexual harm. Despite its prevalence, emotional abuse is often under-reported and misunderstood.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Emotional abuse is defined by experts as a pattern of deliberate non-contact behaviors by a person with a critical relationship role. For a student-athlete, the dynamic they share with their coach is critical. A coach decides playing time, creates daily training plans that impact long-term development, and fosters a cohesive team environment. For these athletes who are away from home, some who are thousands of miles from their parents, a coach takes on the role of an authority figure.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>An investigation by the University of California Berkeley’s Investigative Reporting Program (IRP) found that coaches who inflict emotional abuse on athletes cause severe and lasting damage. Yet, few colleges and universities define, let alone protect, students from it. Policies on emotional abuse are limited and inconsistent, leaving students to find remedies alone.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>IRP reporters reviewed media reports, social media posts, lawsuits and investigations, and interviewed student-athletes, to compile over 100 allegations of emotional abuse in colleges and universities. The reports span Division I powerhouses to small-town colleges from 1997 to April 2025. Reports continue to come to light.</p>
            <p>This research provides the first bird’s eye view of the toll emotional abuse can have on NCAA athletes.</p>

            <h2 class="display-5"><strong>Julia Pernsteiner</strong></h2><p class="lead fw-bold">Jacksonville University<br> Track &amp; Field</p>

            <p>Julia Pernsteiner&rsquo;s track coach, Ron Grigg - a 12-time &ldquo;Coach of the Year&rdquo; recipient, regularly degraded her. &ldquo;Why do I keep you around? You&rsquo;re not smart, you&rsquo;re not fast,&rdquo; she recounted telling a Jacksonville police officer in October 2021. By this point, she had spoken to and collected records from 20 other athletes with similar allegations against Grigg. Pernsteiner sought help again and again - from the Jacksonville University student services, counsellors and administrators, a local hospital, a law firm, a local women&rsquo;s center, legal aid center, Justice Coalition, news organizations, SafeSport an organization created by Congress to report and resolve cases of misconduct and abuse within Olympic and Paralympic organizations, and the NCAA.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Footage from the officer’s body-worn camera shows Pernsteiner’s meeting with him.  When Pernsteiner spoke with the officer, he told her that it wasn’t a criminal statute to make someone feel bad. That if her coach didn't physically touch or hit her, she couldn’t do much.</p>
            <p>The officer’s response is common. The students interviewed for this story said their allegations were dismissed because they weren’t hit or sexually assaulted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A month later, Pernsteiner took her own life in her Jacksonville University dorm room.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At the time of Pernsteiner&rsquo;s death, the school was in the midst of investigating Pernsteiner&rsquo;s allegations, the University&rsquo;s Athletic Director, Alex Ricker-Gilbert said in a statement. That statement, dated July 2022, also announced Grigg&rsquo;s resignation.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2 class="display-5"><strong>Marija Galic</strong></h2><p class="lead fw-bold">University of San Francisco (USF)<br>Basketball</p>
            <p>Marija Galic became a different person under her college head coach, Molly Goodenbour.</p>
            <p>Marija, and twin sister Marta, won four Croatian junior national championships with the Croatian National Basketball Team before playing basketball at the University of San Francisco (USF) in 2018. As members of the national team, they were used to coaches who demanded high levels of skill and dedication.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In June 2021, the sisters filed a lawsuit against USF and Goodenbour alleging the coach made personal, damaging remarks over and over to the sisters. Marija Galic reported she had multiple nervous breakdowns and was haunted by thoughts of suicide. Some mornings she wished she was injured so she wouldn&rsquo;t have to face Goodenbour. When Galic met with USF&rsquo;s athletic director to report, she felt like they were minimizing her experience and &ldquo;gaslighting her.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A psychiatrist who testified during the trial said that Marija didn&rsquo;t report any indication of negative or psychological issues before Goodenbour became her coach.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Galic told the psychiatrist that she couldn’t watch a USF basketball game. She avoided her teammates and any mention of Goodenbour. She indicated if she engaged in any of these behaviors, she had ruminative thoughts, leaving her crying and shaking, her stomach “in knots.” </p>
            <p>Four years later, Galic continues her legal battle. She continues to feel shame and guilt and worries about her future, she said.</p>
            <p>&ldquo; I want people to know that it's not just the time you spend there with the coach. It's so many more years after that, and, and your life changes completely. I changed so much since I came, and not for the good,&rdquo; said Galic.</p>
            <p>She hasn&rsquo;t seen Goodenbour nor played basketball in years, a game she used to love. But she continues to ask herself, &ldquo;Why am I not getting better?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>At Tusculum University in northeastern Tennessee, Jenna Kallenberg and her teammates reported their basketball coach, Meagan Price, to the school&rsquo;s athletic director in 2023. They submitted a four-page complaint, detailing their coach&rsquo;s verbal abuse and behavior. Kallenberg said she experienced panic attacks. The complaint said, &ldquo;at least eight players on the team were in therapy to cope with what she put us through.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Kallenberg said the athletes collected a list of grievances and presented it to their coach, Price. Two weeks later, Price resigned.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In February, with a new head coach, Kallenberg and her teammates played their last game of the season. Together, they had Price removed. Kallenberg, a senior, played the last game of her college career.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Even still, Kallengerg wrote in an Instagram post, &ldquo;I think there will be a piece missing from me for the rest of my life,&rdquo; she wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
            
            
            
            <!-- <p>DATA</p> -->

            <h2 class="display-3 mt-5">Data</h2>
            <p>Currently, there is no centralized dataset that tracks emotional abuse in college sports, making it unclear just how widespread emotional abuse is within NCAA member schools.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>SafeSport maintains a disciplinary database for coaches within the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic movements. Only coaches that also fall under SafeSport&rsquo;s jurisdiction could show up on SafeSport&rsquo;s database. The majority of NCAA coaches do not.</p>
            <p>About 1,100 schools and nearly 540,000 student-athletes fall under the NCAA. The NCAA conducts mental health surveys of student-athletes and provides educational material, but it&nbsp; does not have an emotional abuse policy. Instead, they say schools are responsible for setting and enforcing their own.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Emotional abuse, compared to sexual and physical harm, is often absent from universities' policy handbooks, infraction procedures, and coaching contracts. That absence can create confusion about who bears responsibility to investigate emotional abuse when students report it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The data compiled by IRP seeks to provide new insight about emotional abuse cases.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Records track allegations against a coach. If allegations were made against multiple coaches within the same program each allegation is recorded once. If an allegation was made against the same coach at different schools, then it is included at each program.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Recognizing abuse can be difficult. Coaches also may not intend to act in ways that hurt their athletes. There are seldomly laws or policies in place to protect athletes. The officer in Pernsteiner’s case told her, “making someone feel bad isn’t a criminal statute” before dismissing her allegations. SafeSport offers a <a href="https://eptoolkituscss.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Full-EP-Toolkit-V1.2.pdf">toolkit</a> to help recognize signs of abuse. It is unclear if or how many NCAA coaches interact with this material. The NCAA provides <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2021/2/10/sport-science-institute-mental-health.aspx">mental health best practices</a> for student-athletes, coaches, and other institutional leaders. But, it falls short in fully addressing if a coach is a source in a student-athlete’s emotional distress. &nbsp;</p>
            
            <h2 class="display-3 mt-5">Allegations of Emotional Abuse</h2> 
            <p>IRP reporters compiled allegations of emotional abuse from student-athletes across the country. These records are continuously being reviewed and updated.</p>

            <h2 class="display-3 mt-5">Outcomes for coaches</h2>
            <p>Because allegations aren&rsquo;t tracked and little standards exist, victims like Pernsteiner, Galic and Kallenberg have disparate outcomes.</p>
            <p>In many cases students have found little to no recourse from officials or institutions. Whatever recourse they have found varies from school to school. When schools do investigate allegations, often &ldquo;it's a perfunctory investigation or the consequences are toothless,&rdquo; said Randy Gaw, the attorney representing Galic. Sexual harassment and abuse and physical harm violations would have direct legal recourse.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These inconsistent, ill-defined reporting channels coincide with varied repercussions for accused coaches. Goodenbour continues to coach at University of San Francisco. Others continue to coach in high schools or at community colleges.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another lawyer, Martin Greenberg, who practiced sports and real estate law for 45 years and teaches law at Marquette University, penned an open letter to the NCAA demanding more oversight of emotional abuse. In it he chronicles about 20 cases of coach misconduct. &ldquo;Universities need to be more concerned with protecting their student-athletes from an abusive coach than protecting themselves from legal action,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
